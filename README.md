This repository showcases a common yet often overlooked JavaScript error: improper handling of null values in function arguments.  The `bug.js` file demonstrates the issue, where the addition function `foo` does not produce the desired output when a null value is passed as an argument.  The solution, in `bugSolution.js`, includes explicit null checks to provide robust and predictable function behavior.
